# Project 3 - BGP Router

## High Level Approach
- The first thing I did was to look at config files and try and understand the configs to the best of my ability. Then I tried to follow the implementation steps as best as possible and try to always come back to that in order to have guidance. Figuring out how to message handling, route table management

## Challenges Face
- The Biggest Challenge for me is figuring out how the router was going to work. There is a lot of things to consider and take note of when implementing all of the methods. Also there was a lot to try to learn outside of what the project tells us. I had some issues figuring out the aggregation part of the tests. Also figuring out how to manage updating routing tables efficiently. 

## Testing Code
- To test the code, I just used the simulator that was given and used ./test and ./run functions in order to see if my code will pass these configs.
